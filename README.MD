# PG-ABM: An Agent-based Model of Politogenesis

## Abstract

Politogenesis concerns about how and why polities are originated. In this study we first discuss a formal theory of politogenesis, and then propose a model (agent-based simulation) to help us explore how the most primitive socially complex polities, i.e. chiefdoms, can emerge from simple non-complex societies.

Members of simple, non-complex societies are socially unranked (egalitarian), do not have   centralized managements, and their social relations are primarily based on kin-relations. On the other hand, in chiefdoms (i.e. the simplest complex societies) political and economic power is exercised by a single person (chief) who is supported by a group of persons where each rules local communities. Therefore, chiefdoms are socially ranked, have a specialized management, and the social relations are non-kinship based.

The core questions in the politogenesis are three:

- How the requirements are met (potential attained) for a simple society to start evolving into an initial social complexity?
- What are the characteristics of these requirements (elements of the potential)?
- Under what circumstances can the potential be realized (and hence the initial social complexity is emerged)?

The goal of our model is to help us answering these questions.
